/*
 * The dollar change remaining after an amount paid is used to
 * a restaurant bill of amount check can be calculated using
 * the following C statements:
 * - determine the amount of pennies in the change
 * 	+ change = (paid - check) * 10
 * - determine the number of dollars in the change
 *  	+ dollars = change / 100
 * a) Using the previous statements as a starting point,
 *    write a C program that calculates the number of dollar
 *    bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in the change
 *    when $10 is used to pay a bill of $6.07.
